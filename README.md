# Wuhan-University
# Engaged in research of Minorities Features Extraction and Recognition of Human Faces, (also named as the Ethnic Features Extraction and recognition of Human Faces). Proposed and conducted the use of Deep Learning Method for Minorities Identification.

# Responsibilities:
•	Processed the image resizing and object recognition (in my case, faces) with Open Source Computer Vision library (OpenCV).

•	Used Linear Discriminant Analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Extract algebraic features by PCA+LDA, extract geometric features by Gabor + Dynamic model. 

•	Used Dynamic Link Matching (DLM) architecture for gender and ethnic classification of face images. Used Radial Basis Functions (RBF) to compare with traditional three-layer back-propagation network.

•	Conducted feature selection based on mutual information criteria of max-dependency, maxrelevance, and min-redundancy.

•	3D Face Recognition: Gabor-Based Kernel Partial-Least-Squares Discrimination Features for Face Recognition.

•	Face recognition based on the fusion of global and local HOG features of face images.

•	A Two-Dimensional Partial Least Squares (PLS) with Application to Biological Image Recognition and super-resolution methods applied to Face Recognition. 

•	Utilized deep learning model Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to perform image classification and object detection.

•	Attempted to build a Human Face Generator by Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). Synthesize new images via DCGAN (Deep Convolutional GAN).

•	Worked on various machine vision application: CNN for image classification, Neural Style Transfer. R-CNN (fast), Yolo, R-FCN for object detection. GAN for Image Synthesis. 

•	Engaged in studying ranking and recommendation algorithms and helped developing an engineering management information platform – Foundation Pit Monitoring System, specialized in website development based on JavaScript, ExtJS and Java.

•	Solved multi-label classification problem with classification algorithms (SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression) and achieved a 79% accuracy. Leveraged a Naive Bayes Classier to perform cross-validations on the training set with Multinomial and Bernoulli distributions and compared with logistical regression.
